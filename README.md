## Translation files (i18n)

All translation modifications need to be created on a separate branch by running the following commands:

```Bash
    git checkout -b i18n/update-ja-translation
```

You will need to change the name of the branch accordingly. Once your work is done you need to run `git push` and create a PR out of the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Please pay attention to possible references from one translation to another.

### 🖼️ Updating translation files with a GUI

Download and install QtLinguist, use it to edit the translation files.

You can download it from [here](https://download.qt.io/linguist_releases/) for Windows. For other OSes you'll need to download Qt6 via a package manager or the online installer Qt provides.

### 📝 Updating translation files with a code editor

> [!Tip]
> Use XML Syntax highlighting for a great visual feedback.

In order to translate an `unfinished` entry:

```XML
<message>
    <location filename="../src/CartDetailsWidget.cpp" line="27"/>
    <source>Unofficial cartridge</source>
    <translation type="unfinished"></translation>
</message>
```

You need to update the `translation` XML property by removing the `unfinished` value:

```XML
<message>
    <location filename="../src/CartDetailsWidget.cpp" line="27" />
    <source>Unofficial cartridge</source>
    <translation>非公式カートリッジ</translation>
</message>
```

If you're correcting a translation, you can simply update the contents inside the `translation` XML tag.

### ⚙️ Optional compilation

Once you're done updating all entries you need to recompile the translation file and generate a `qm` file by running the command:

```Bash
    lrelease i18n/main_ja.ts i18n/main_ja.qm
```
